# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

Utilizing the ride sharing data from various cities, Pyber is looking to analyze total weekly fares for each city. By comparing weekly fares Pyber will understand relation between ridership and fares for each city. The analysis will help Pyber to provide better accessibility in areas

Data is visualized by using analytics tools such as Python 3.7.6 including Pandas Library, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0 


## Results

The summary of total weekly ridership displays that:
  - Urban areas has most riders and drivers, compared to suburban and rural areas. Urban areas also have most affordable fares.
  - There is a direct correlation between number of riders and affordability of rides.
  - Rural areas have least affordable rides and have least number of rides as well.
  - Average fare per driver is least in the Urban areas, whereas it is almost triple in the rural areas.

Total fare per city type when visualized provides following observations:
  - Urban cities provides the most revenue for Pyber
  - The ridership follows a similar pattern of high and lows in all three city types- urban, sub urban and rural.
  - Total fares earned in urban cities are almost four times compared to rural areas.

## Summary

Recommendations to Pyber: 
  - Rural and Suburban cities have higher average ride fare, which can be result of longer distance travelled. By bringing in more drivers, Pyber can ensure more accessibility for riders, and it may also lower the fare cost to the rider
  - Based on the line chart, surge in ridership is witnessed in the starting of the month. By getting more drivers during those times can help Pyber earn more revenue
  - Ridership in all three city types closely follow similar trends, however, ridership in suburban cities is on the rise. It may be beneficial for Pyber to focus more on suburban cities.
